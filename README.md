# CodeBard: Weaving Stories with Code

Welcome to CodeBard! This is a place where storytelling meets programming in the most delightful and unexpected ways.

## What is CodeBard?

CodeBard is a collaborative storytelling platform with a unique twist. Instead of writing prose, participants contribute lines of pseudo-code to build a shared narrative. Our custom engine interprets programming constructs like loops, conditionals, and variables as narrative actions, translating the logical flow of the code into an unfolding story.

For example, a `for loop` might make a character repeat an action, an `if/else` statement could introduce a branching plot point, and variable assignments can track a character's inventory or emotional state.

This project is a fantastic and fun way to learn about parsers, interpreters, and real-time web technologies through a uniquely creative and humorous lens.

## Features

Here are some of the core features we're building:

*   **Real-time Collaborative Editor:** Write pseudo-code together with other storytellers.
*   **Narrative Interpreter:** A custom engine that reads your code and translates it into a story in real-time.
*   **Dynamic Story Output:** Watch the story unfold as the code is written and executed.
*   **Branching Narratives:** Use `if/else` blocks to create choices and alternate paths in the plot.
*   **Loops for Repetitive Action:** Employ `for` and `while` loops to create repeating events, cycles, or character habits.
*   **Story State with Variables:** Define characters, items, and world states using variables.
